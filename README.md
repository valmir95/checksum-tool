# checksum-tool
A fast and multi-thread python script which checksums all files in a given directory and keeps track of what files have been added, changed or deleted. Simply run the python script, and you will be entered in "interactive mode" which guides you through.
A Windows executable is in the Release section if you wish to run this without python. Executables for Linux and macOS will be available in the future.
