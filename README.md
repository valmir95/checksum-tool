# checksum-tool
A fast and multi-thread python script which checksums all files in a given directory and keeps track of what files have been added, changed or deleted. Simply run the python script, and you will be entered in "interactive mode" which guides you through.

Packaged executables for Windows and Linux(Ubuntu) are available in the release section if you simply want to run it without python or the other neccessary packages.
